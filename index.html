<p style="font-family:Montserrat"> Despite the recent increase in concussion awareness, 50% of concussions remain undiagnosed for several weeks, placing patients at further risk of permanent brain damage. Locaze is a mobile application that uses eye tracking technology to assess concussion risk in athletes, providing users with accessible, time-efficient, and comprehensive results. </p>

<div class = "row"><div class = "column"><h3> Accessible </h3><p style="font-family:Montserrat"> The concussion assessment can be completed on a variety of different platforms. </p></div>
<div class = "column"><h3> Time Efficient </h3><p style="font-family:Montserrat"> Locaze's complete concussion assessment can be completed in under five minutes, providing users with rapid, accurate results. Our assessment is four times faster than leading competitors. </p> </div>
<div class = "column"><h3> Comprehensive </h3><p style="font-family:Montserrat"> Users complete a series of 4 clinically validated eye movement tests to assess concussion risk. Comprehensively, these tests account for the most commonly observed oculomotor damages that occur after a concussion. </p></div>
<h1 style="font-size: 6;"> Our Clinically Validated Oculomotor Tests </h1>
<h2 style="font-size: 6;"> Saccades Test </h2>
<p style="font-family:Montserrat"> Saccadic function is characterized by the rapid shift of the center of gaze between multiple visual fields. 30% of concussed patients demonstrate saccadic dysfunction. Locaze tests saccadic eye movements by prompting users to use their eyes to track a dot that appears in different horizontal, vertical, and diagonal patterns. The time taken to locate the dot will be compared to the baseline. </p>
<h2 style="font-size: 6;"> Smooth Pursuit Eye Movements Test </h2>
<p style="font-family:Montserrat"> Smooth pursuit function is characterized by continuously tracking a moving target without disruption. Current data suggests that concussed patients often demonstrate impaired visual tracking capabilities. Locaze tests for smooth pursuit eye movements by prompting users to track a moving red dot as it varies its speed. The percent of time that the gaze diverges from the predicted path will be compared to the baseline.</p>
<h2 style="font-size: 6;"> Accommodation Test </h2>
<p style="font-family:Montserrat"> Accommodation is characterized by the shift in eye focus to maintain a clear image of an object as it varies its distance from the observer. 51% of concussed patients demonstrate accommodative dysfunction. Locaze tests accommodation with a similar test to convergence, except the user will be prompted to close one eye. The distance at which the image is no longer clear will be compared to the baseline.</p>
<h2 style="font-size: 6;"> Vestibular-Ocular Reflex Test </h2>
<p style="font-family:Montserrat"> Vestibular-ocular reflex (VOR) stabilizes gaze by moving the eyes in response to head movement. Current data suggests VOR abnormalities are present in over 50% of mild traumatic brain injury patients. </p>
